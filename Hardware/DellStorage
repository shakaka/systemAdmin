1.)  Connect all the necessary physical connection to the main server, i.e. the fibre optic cable
2.)  Download and place the DELL_MDSS_Consolidated_RDVD_6_5_0_1.iso (installation media) in the server.
3.) Create a directory to mount the DELL installation directory
~]# mkdir /mnt/to_mount
On this example, 'to_mount' is the directory created to mount for iso file.
4.) Mount the iso file using iso9660 -o loop to the created mount directory
~]# mount -t iso9660 -o loop /home/Richard/DELL_MDSS_Consolidated_RDVD_6_5_0_1.iso /mnt/to_mount
5.) Before you run the silent install command, make sure to run the following script(s) to install prerequisite packages (vim Readme.txt for more info).
Inside of the mount directory, run linux_hostnameupdates.sh as this is running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5.
cd /mnt/to_mount
~]# ./linux_hostnameupdates.sh
6.) After installation of DELL, open and configure the SAN from utility manager (make sure on the root user):
Run SMclient under /opt/dell/mdstoragesoftware/mdstoragemanager/client/
~]# ./opt/dell/mdstoragesoftware/mdstoragemanager/client/SMclient
7.) Setting up Multipath devices on linux server (source master):
Make sure machine is installed with device-mapper-multipath program
Do a yum search device-mapper-multipath to list out the repository of multipath packages
Make sure user_friendly_name is set to yes for /etc/multipath.conf file
Use multipath -v3 to print out multipath-able devices
Edit the multipath configuration files if necessary:
/etc/multipath.conf
/etc/multipath/bindings
/etc/multipath/wwids
Add in the wwids for the devices if they are not shown on lsblk as multipath-devices
Restart multipathd for the changes to take place, or if not restart the machine if is necessary
Verify multipath configuration using
dmsetup ls --target=multipath
multipath -ll
If this is a fresh device (being installed for the first time), use gparted utility to create a partition table (gpt) on the SAN
Format the device using mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/mpatha1
Reboot the system for the changes to take place
8. ) Add the UUID of multipath to /etc/fstab.
run the blkid on root user to show to UUID
~]# blkid
e.g.
/dev/mapper/mpatha: UUID="cf3b6b29-ba78-4753-bd29-dc01178c2f4f" TYPE="ext4"
9.) Before mounting the multipath to HIS directory, make sure to stop the running HIS on oracle
~]# oracle_stop his
10.) Then mount the partition using /dev/mapper/mapatha1 (this will reflect on the linux server after reboot, enter lsblk command to determine)
~]# mount /dev/mapper/mapatha1 /orac/u01/oradata/his
11.) Start the HIS on oracle
~]# oracle_start his
NOTE: After mounted the HIS on SAN, take into consideration to run the RDBCREATE for HIS on the source master to avoid failure running the his.
