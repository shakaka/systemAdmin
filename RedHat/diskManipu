Run sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

Press O and press Enter (creates a new table)

Press N and press Enter (creates a new partition)

Press P and press Enter (makes a primary partition)

Then press 1 and press Enter (creates it as the 1st partition)

Finally, press W (this will write any changes to disk)

Okay now you have a partition, now you need a filesystem.

Run sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

Now you can add it to fstab

You need to add it to /etc/fstab use your favourite text editor

Be careful with this file as it can quite easily cause your system not to boot.

Add a line for the drive, the format would look like this.

This assumes the partition is formatted as ext4 as per mkfs above

#device        mountpoint             fstype    options  dump   fsck

/dev/sdb1    /home/yourname/mydata    ext4    defaults    0    1
/dev/mapper/mpatha1     /orac/u01/oradata/his   ext4    defaults        0 1
